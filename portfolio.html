        <p>A side project as an excuse to learn commonly used interface components
          such as Collapsing Toolbar Layout and features such as animations to really make
          an application look polished to the user. Hopefully will function as a simple
          application to add and view recipes, with a smooth user interface and
          some more advanced features if I end up releasing it.

        <p>My Dissertation project, implementing the concept of placing a number
          of Android devices edge-to-edge to form a larger display. In this basic
          application, the display functions to show an image over the devices.
        </p>
        <p>The devices are interconnected using P2P (Peer-to-Peer) with one
          acting as a server sharing parts of the image with the other client
          devices. The relative positions of each device are calculated from a
          number of pinch gestures between the screens of 2 adjacent devices.

        <p>At my second HackNotts, my team decided to make a fun image processing
          based webcam filter desktop application. We used an existing Java library
          to access a webcam feed, while I made the user interface using Swing and
          my team spent their time making a variety of effects that can be easily
          swapped out and combined.
        </p>
        <p>Although unexpected, with this hack my team managed to place second in the
          rankings, winning a raspberry pi in the process.</p>

        <a href="Demos/GifMeAMovie/public/index.html"> <img src="Images/Demos/GifMeAMovie.png" alt="GifMeAMovie"/> </a>
        <p>A web application that returns GIFs summarising a given movie. We
        pre-parsed ~2000 movie scripts found using a python web crawler, ran our
        Natural Language Processing algorithm on them, and stored the resulting
        keywords in a database, to be indexed at the user's request.</p>
        <p>This was the result of a year long group project I had to complete at
        university, in which we had to pitch for, design and implement a piece
        of software for an industry client.
        </p>
        <p>My contributions included constructing parts of the NLP algorithm, and
        designing/implementing the whole front end, from HTML, CSS and responsiveness
        oriented Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>I led the team throughout the year, where we used industry tools like
        Git and Trello, while following the Scrum framework and participating in
        periodic meetings with the client. At the end of the year we had to present
        the software at an open day to all the yeargroups clients.</p>

        <p>As the conclusion of my C++ module at university, I had to make a game
        using a framework that my lecturer had provided(based on SDL). This is what
        I came up with, based on the Tanks minigame found on the 2007 released Wii
        Play.
        </p>
        <p>As I only had a month to complete this project, there were some features
        that I wished I could add, but I am still very proud of what i did, since this
        was one of the more complex games submitted.

        <p>At my very first hackathon, HackNotts hosted at my own university, together with
        a friend of mine, we attempted to make a java game using realisting water
        movements, using knowledge that he had on water physics.
        </p>
        <p>Although we ended up running out of time, it was still a very fun and
        rewarding experience, so fun in fact that I also took part the following year.</p>

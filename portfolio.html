        <h3>Streak App(In Progress)</h3>
        <img src="Images/Demos/streak.png" alt="streak"/>
        <p>My first official Android app, made to keep people motivated to do
        periodic tasks that they may struggle with, such as going to the gym, by
        keeping track of the "streak" of how many times they have done it before.
        </p>
        <p>
        It is still in progress, but the first version has been completed, and
        I hope to release it on the app store within the next few months.

        <p>I thought this would be a fun project to do, and it had been a while
        since I had made a website from the ground up, so here we are.</p>

        <a href="Demos/GifMeAMovie/public/index.html"> <img src="Images/Demos/gifmeamovie.png" alt="GifMeAMovie"/> </a>
        <p>A web application that returns GIFs summarising a given movie. We
        pre-parsed ~2000 movie scripts found using a python web crawler, ran our
        Natural Language Processing algorithm on them, and stored the resulting
        keywords in a database, to be indexed at the user's request.</p>
        <p>This was the result of a year long group project I had to complete at
        university, in which we had to pitch for, design and implement a piece
        of software for an industry client.
        </p>
        <p>My contributions included constructing parts of the NLP algorithm, and
        designing/implementing the whole front end, from HTML, CSS and responsiveness
        oriented Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>I led the team throughout the year, where we used industry tools like
        Git and Trello, while following the Scrum framework and participating in
        periodic meetings with the client. At the end of the year we had to present
        the software at an open day to all the yeargroups clients.</p>

        <h3>Turrets</h3>
        <img src="Images/Demos/turrets.png" alt="Turrets"/>
        <p>As the conclusion of my C++ module at university, I had to make a game
        using a framework that my lecturer had provided(based on SDL). This is what
        I came up with, based on the Tanks minigame found on the 2007 released Wii
        Play.
        </p>
        <p>As I only had a month to complete this project, there were some features
        that I wished I could add, but I am still very proud of what i did, since this
        was one of the more complex games submitted.

        <p>This was a piece of coursework that I received in a Human-Computer
        Interaction module at University. We had to design an Android app for
        use at a music festival.</p>

        <p>At my very first hackathon, HackNotts hosted at my own university, together with
        a colleague of mine, we attempted to make a java game using realisting water
        movements, using knowledge that my colleague had on water physics.
        </p>
        <p>Although we ended up running out of time, it was still a very fun and
        rewarding experience, so I will be participating in HackNotts again this year.</p>

        <h3>Conflux</h3>
        <img src="Images/Demos/conflux.png" alt="Conflux"/>
        <p>This was the very first serious piece of software that I ever made,
        it was my final project for my A-levels, and I had a full school year to
        complete it's development (plus it's corresponding documentation).
        </p>
        <p>It was developed in Python, the only language I knew at the time, and one
        I had been taught over the previous school year. It uses Pygame, a set of
        libraries enabling game programming in Python.
        </p>
        <p>Although I see its faults now, at the time it got the highest marks
          that the school had seen before, a full 100%, which is why I still value
          it as my first step into software development.
